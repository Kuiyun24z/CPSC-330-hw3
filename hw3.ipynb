Individuals earning >50K tend to be older and have higher values of education.num compared to those earning ≤50K. The hours.per.week distribution for the >50K class is slightly shifted to the right, indicating longer working hours on average. Both capital.gain and capital.loss are highly right-skewed and zero-inflated, with non-zero values occurring more frequently among the >50K group. In contrast, fnlwgt shows substantial overlap between income classes and does not appear to strongly differentiate them."

    "Typically, data isn't readily formatted for direct input into machine learning models. It's crucial for a machine learning practitioner to examine each column and determine an effective method for encoding its information. Let's determine the types of features we have and come up with suitable encoding strategies for them. "

    "| Feature | Transformation | Explanation\n",
    "| --- | ----------- | ----- |\n",
    "| age | scaling with `StandardScaler` |  A numeric feature with no missing values, ranging from 17 to 90. Scaling is recommended due to its distinct range compared to other numeric features. While MinMaxScaler might be more suitable, using StandardScaler should be fine too.|\n",
    "| workclass | imputation, one-hot encoding | A categorical variable with missing values, imputation are used to handle missing entries and one-hot encoding is appropriate since the categories are nominal with no inherent ordering.|\n",
    "| fnlwgt | drop | fnlwgt is a census sampling weight rather than an individual-level attribute. It does not directly describe personal characteristics and is therefore not meaningful for prediction, so it is dropped. |\n",
    "| education | ordinal encoding | A categorical feature representing education levels with a natural ordering (e.g., from less education to more education). Ordinal encoding preserves this order information.|\n",
    "| education.num | drop | This feature is a numeric representation of education and is redundant when education is already included using ordinal encoding. To avoid multicollinearity, it is dropped.|\n",
    "| marital.status | one-hot encoding  | A categorical feature with multiple nominal categories and no inherent ordering. One-hot encoding allows the model to treat each marital status independently.|\n",
    "| occupation | imputation, one-hot encoding  | A categorical feature with missing values. Imputation is needed to handle missing entries, and one-hot encoding is suitable since occupations are nominal categories.|\n",
    "| relationship | one-hot encoding  | A categorical feature describing family relationships with no natural ordering. One-hot encoding is appropriate to represent each category separately.|\n",
    "| race | drop  | This feature may raise fairness and ethical concerns and may not be appropriate to include in a predictive model. It is therefore excluded.|\n",
    "| sex | one-hot encoding with \"binary=True\" | A binary categorical feature with two possible values. One-hot encoding with binary=True efficiently represents this feature using a single indicator variable.|\n",
    "| capital.gain | scaling with `StandardScaler` |  A numeric feature with a wide range and strong right skew. Scaling helps ensure it is on a comparable scale with other numeric features and improves model performance for scale-sensitive algorithms.| \n",
    "| capital.loss | scaling with `StandardScaler` | A numeric feature with a wide range and skewed distribution. Scaling is applied to prevent it from disproportionately influencing the model due to its magnitude. |\n",
    "| hours.per.week | scaling with `StandardScaler` | A numeric feature representing weekly working hours with a range that differs from other numeric features. Scaling helps standardize its contribution in the model.|\n",
    "| native.country | imputation, one-hot encoding | A categorical feature with missing values. Imputation is required to handle missing entries, and one-hot encoding is suitable since countries are nominal categories with no inherent order.| \n",

This allows information from the test data to influence the preprocessing, violating the principle that test data should remain unseen during training.\n",
    "2. The Golden Rule ensures that no information from the test set is used during training or preprocessing, which provides an unbiased estimate of model performance. Violating it does not necessarily give a worse classifier, but it often leads to overly optimistic performance estimates that do not generalize to new data.\n",
    "3. First, pipelines help prevent data leakage by ensuring that preprocessing steps are applied consistently within cross-validation and model fitting. Second, they make workflows more reproducible and easier to tune, since preprocessing and modeling steps can be treated as a single object.\n",
    "4. A ColumnTransformer is appropriate when different subsets of features require different preprocessing steps, such as scaling numeric features and one-hot encoding categorical features. It allows these transformations to be applied in parallel while keeping the feature pipeline organized and consistent."
